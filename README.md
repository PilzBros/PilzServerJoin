# Pilz Server Join

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin is from Minecraft Beta around 2010 for the [PilzBros Network](https://pilzbros.com). It was created by the developer while they were in High School. It's no longer maintained and last ran on MC 1.6+. It's being published here for historical purposes. The code quality, quite frankly, is abysmal. Don't code like this.

## Game Design
This is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that fires fireworks when a player joins the server.
